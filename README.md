Write large markdown documents, including API Blueprints, while keeping things DRY (don't repeat yourself).

Hercule is a command-line tool for transcluding markdown documents, including API documentation written in [API Blueprint](http://apiblueprint.org) format. With Hercule you can easily break complex documents into smaller logical documents, preventing repetition and improving consistency.

## Installation

[Node.js](http://nodejs.org) and [NPM](http://npmjs.org) is required.

```
$ npm install -g hercule
```

## Example: API Blueprint

Borrowing from the Apiary [Gist Fox Tutorial example](http://apiary.io/blueprint), API Blueprint documents can be split into logical files and share common elements.

This example uses a different file for `gists` and `gists/{id}`, and shares a common file `gist.json`.

```
$ hercule gist-fox.source.apib -o gist-fox.apib
```

Hercule accepts a single source file, in this example `gist-fox.source.apib`.

```markdown
FORMAT: 1A

# Gist Fox API
Gist Fox API is a **pastes service** similar to [GitHub's Gist](http://gist.github.com).

{{blueprint/gist.md}}
{{blueprint/gists.md}}
```

Each resource is being stored in its own file, `gist.md` and `gists.md` respectively.

```markdown
## Gist [/gists/{id}]
A single Gist object.
The Gist resource is the central resource in the Gist Fox API.
It represents one paste - a single text note.

+ Parameters
  + id (string) ... ID of the Gist in the form of a hash.

+ Model

    + Body

          {{gist.json}}

### Retrieve a Single Gist [GET]

+ Response 200

  [Gist][]
```

```markdown
## Gists Collection [/gists{?since}]
Collection of all Gists.

+ Model

    + Body

          {
            "gists": [
              {{gist.json}}
            ]
          }


### List All Gists [GET]

+ Response 200

  [Gists Collection][]
```

The common JSON body is stored in `gist.json`.

```json
{
  "id": "42",
  "created_at": "2014-04-14T02:15:15Z",
  "description": "Description of Gist",
  "content": "String contents"
}
```

## Example: Technical documents

Writing long documents, particularly technical documents, may require repetition of certain information.
Hercule helps reduce repetition in line with DRY–don't repeat yourself–principles.

```markdown
# Transclusions in Markdown

John Appleseed
(University of Technology)

## Abstract
{{src/abstract.md}}

...

```

Transcluding a document:

```bash
hercule src/transclusions-in-markdown.md -o final.md
```

Omitting the `output` argument allows the output to be piped into other text processing tools:

```bash
hercule src/transclusions-in-markdown.md | pandoc -o final.pdf
```

## Syntax

Example: `report-final.md` is generated by transcluding `apple.md` into `report.md`.

```bash
hercule src/report.md -o report-final.md
```

```markdown
{{apple.md}}
```

Example: `apple.md` and `common/footer.md` are parametrically transcluded into `fruit.md`, which is transcluded into `report.md`.

```bash
hercule src/report.md -o report-final.md
```

```markdown
{{fruit.md fruit:apple.md footer:common/footer.md}}
```

### Simple transclusion

```markdown
An example document

{{DEPENDENCY}}
```

A document may contain any number of transclusions.
Dependencies are parsed, and child dependencies transcluded.
Dependency paths are relative, in the typical `node.js` style.

### Parameterised transclusion

```markdown
An example document

{{DEPENDENCY PLACEHOLDER:DEPENDENCY}}
```

Parameterised transclusions allow a dependency to be specified from the parent file.
The context is only passed to the level immediately below.

### Whitespace sensitivity

Leading whitespace is significant in Markdown.
Hercule preserves whitespace at the beginning of each line.

```markdown
Binary sort example:

  {{snippet.c}}

```

Each line of `snippet.c` will be indented with the whitespace preceding it.

This is also useful for nesting lists or including paragraphs within a list.

```markdown
- Apple
  {{apple-varieties.md}}
- Orange
  {{orange-varieties.md}}
- Pear
  {{pear-varieties.md}}
```
